Project Overview
The Book Recommendation System is designed to help users find books they might enjoy based on their preferences. This system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest books that are similar to those a user has already read and liked, or that are popular among other users with similar tastes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis, the system provides personalized book recommendations.

Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on the preferences of similar users.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Suggests books that are similar to the ones a user has liked in the past.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on the content features such as genre, author, and book description.
Hybrid Filtering: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
User Interface: An intuitive interface allowing users to search for books, view recommendations, and explore book details.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
Deployment: Heroku, AWS, Streamlit
How It Works
Data Collection: The system collects data on user preferences, including book ratings and reviews.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the data.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted and transformed to create meaningful input for the recommendation algorithms.
Model Training: Machine learning models are trained using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.
Recommendation Generation: The trained models generate personalized book recommendations for users.
User Interaction: Users can interact with the system through a web interface to get book recommendations based on their preferences.
Key Benefits
Personalized Recommendations: Users receive book suggestions tailored to their tastes and preferences.
Enhanced Discoverability: Helps users discover new books they might not have found on their own.
User Engagement: Keeps users engaged by continuously providing relevant book recommendations.
